This program monitors internet browsers and extracts current web addresses from them by DDE (dynamic data exchange) technology.
In the version 2.2.0 only Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox is supported for link monitoring. There are several bugs. 
In version 2.2; exporting and importing links feature is added.

Coder does not grant that this program will work correctly according to the wishes of the user and does not have any responsibility about it.
